# Quaranteam

Problem Statement
Community building for everyone who has/have been facing problems due to the COVID situation in our country.

Why This Idea?
Covid-19 has had various impacts on our lives in different ways.
Our country has been the first one to report 90,000 cases in a day and Corona Virus has entered into several homes unexpectedly.
With this we decided to come up with a project that provides a one stop destination to real time statistics , helping you manage isolation in your homes, providing you the best resources and volunteers during this time and a place where you could vent out through your blogs.
